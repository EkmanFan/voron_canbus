BTT Manta M8P V2.0 with CB1 CM4
IMPORTANT note - you will need to add a jumper to the 120R (J14) on both the mainboard and the CAN toolhead.
STM32H723
CanBOOT Config (note this just uses the default USB communication interface)


Micro-controller ARchitecture (STMicroelectronics STM32)--->
Processor model (STM32H723)--->
Build Katapult deployment application (Do not build)--->
Clock Reference (25 MHz cristal)--->
Application start offset (128KiB offset)--->
USB ids --->
() GPIO pins to set on bootloader entry
[*] Support bootloader entry on rapid double click of reset button
[ ] Enable bootloader entry on button (or gpio) state
[*] Enable Status LED
(PA13) Status LED GPIO Pin


Klipper Config uses USB-CAN-Bridge
[*] Enable extral low-level configuation options
 Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32)  --->
    Processor model (STM32H723)  --->
    Bootloader offset (128KiB bootloader (SKR SE BX v2.0))  --->
    Clock Reference (25 MHz crystal)  --->
    Communication interface (USB to CAN bus bridge (USB on PA11/PA12))  --->
    CAN bus interface (CAN bus (on PD0/PD1))  --->
    USB ids  --->
(1000000) CAN bus speed
(PA13) GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup

IMPORTANT NOTE :
When following the Esoterical tutorial, I found that after following it to the end, I had to reflash the Canboot and Klipper again....
